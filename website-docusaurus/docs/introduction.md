This documentation site refers to the [ILCB server](https://ilc-online-test.net), how it was built and is run, and refers also to several other external resources that one can use for experimenting online.

## ILCB

The [Institute for Language, Communication and the Brain](https://www.ilcb.fr) is a French joint research institute bringing together experts in linguistics, neuroscience, psychology, medicine and computer science to understand and to model the way that language functions. The main objective of this 10-year scientific adventure is to create a generic model of the processing of language and its cerebral bases. The institutional support comes from [CNRS](http://www.cnrs.fr), [INSERM](https://www.inserm.fr), [Aix-Marseille Université](https://www.univ-amu.fr) and [Université d'Avignon](http://univ-avignon.fr).

## Table of Resources

Online experiments can be written in javascript from scratch, but there are many tools, libraries or all-in-one solutions to help building, managing and promoting an online experiment.

_The list below reflects the knowledge of the researchers and IT support staff involved in the ILCB server initiative._

### OSWeb

[OSWeb](https://github.com/shyras/osweb/) is an online runtime for OpenSesame experiments.


:::tip

Export your experiment as a Jatos zip file, and import it in JATOS.
There are plenty of tutorials on the web, and the forum is quite active

:::

The OSWeb page covers all you need to know about this free software : https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/3.2/manual/osweb/

Basically, everything in OpenSesame that is not python scripted by hand can be turned into a web component, which in turn can be tweaked by javascript inlines. Export your experiment as a Jatos zip file, and import it in JATOS (jatos.ilcb-online-test.net)

:::tip
ILCB users can access a free online instance of Limesurvey Community Edition at https://columbo.univ-amu.fr. To open an account, refer to the ENT help desk.

##### ILCB users

On https://ent.univ-amu.fr, go to _e-scolarité_ then _limesurvey_ as in the following picture

![limesurvey-amu](/img/limesurvey-amu.png)

On April 2020, the service ran version 3.15.5. The main page consists of menu at the top including a tutorial and templates to load, and buttons for creating an questionnaire.


##### From the wikipedia page about limesurvey:

LimeSurvey is a web application that is installed to the user’s server. After installation users can manage LimeSurvey from a web-interface. Users can use rich text in questions and messages, using a rich text editor, and images and videos can be integrated into the survey. The layout and design of the survey can be modified under a template system. Templates can be changed in a WYSIWYG HTML editor. Additionally, templates can be imported and exported through the template editor. Once a survey is finalized, the user can activate it, making it available for respondents to view and answer. Likewise, questions can also be imported and exported through the editor interface. LimeSurvey has no limit on the number of surveys a user can create, nor is there a limit on how many participants can respond. Aside from technical and practical constraints, there is also no limit on the number of questions each survey may have.

Questions are added in groups. The questions within each group are organized on the same page. Surveys can include a variety of question types that take many response formats, including multiple choice, text input, drop-down lists, numerical input, slider input, and simple yes/no input. Questions can be arranged in a two-dimensional array, with options along one axis based on the questions on the other axis. Questions can depend on the results of other questions. For instance, a respondent might only be asked about transportation for his or her commute if he or she responded affirmatively to a question about having a job.

LimeSurvey also provides basic statistical and graphical analysis of survey results. Surveys can either be publicly accessible or be strictly controlled through the use of "once-only" tokens, granted only to selected participants. Additionally, participants can be anonymous, or LimeSurvey can track the IP addresses of the participants. A much more detailed listing of features can be found on the LimeSurvey web page.
